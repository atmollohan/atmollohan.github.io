Oh ..... I didnt see you there. It looks like you stumbled across my Portfolio. Feel free to look around or if you're in a rush grab a copy of my [resume](resume.current.v1.3.pdf). A resume only gives you a page worth of information. So I figured it would be better to wear my JS hat and build a portfolio from modern frameworks. This is a good space for me to show off what I can do in both my 9-5 and my 5-9.

I grew up as 1 of a pair. Believe it or not we are fraternal.

In case you're curious about this site specifically, I used a React-based, open-source framework called Gatsby using a fairly minimal [design](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension) that I pulled from their templates. I have the source code on [github](https://github.com/atmollohan/atmollohan.github.io) and am deploying it automatically on commits to main with github actions.
 my 5-9.
