Oh... I didn't see you there. It looks like you stumbled across my portfolio. Feel free to look around or, if you're in a rush, grab a copy of my [resume](resume.current.v1.7.pdf). A resume only gives you a page's worth of information. So I figured it would be better to wear my JS hat and build a portfolio with modern frameworks. This is a good space for me to show what I can do in both my 9-5 and my 5-9.

Here are some technical areas of interest:

- Cloud Computing
- Self Hosting
- Application Development
- AI / ML Development
- Computer Hardware
- Workflow Automation
- Software Security
- Data Engineering
- Decentralized Finance
- Ecommerce
- Digital Design

Reach out if you want to collaborate or just take a look around and let me know what you think!

Can you guess which one is me?

I grew up as one of a pair. Believe it or not, we are fraternal.

In case you're curious about this site specifically, I used a React-based, open-source framework called Gatsby using a fairly minimal [design](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension) that I pulled from their templates. I have the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/atmollohan/atmollohan.github.io) and am deploying it automatically on commits to main with GitHub Actions.
