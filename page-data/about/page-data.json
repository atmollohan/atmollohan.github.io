With a population of about 20,000 it is a small town full of some great parks and Rhode Island's own Twin River Casino. I often reflect on the amazing memories and lifelong friendships I made during my Rhode Island childhood. Growing up, we spent winters skiing in Vermont and summers at the beach in Narragansett with friends and family. It's a dream of mine to own a large lake house and host all my friends and family. Right now I am absorbing all the knowledge and experience I can from the incredible people I've worked with in order to grow both as a person and a professional. If you can make yourself 1% better every day, over the course of a year that compounds into meaningful improvement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/wholeFamSki.jpg\" alt=\"retro mollohans at killington\">\n<img src=\"../images/wholefam.jpg\" alt=\"mollohans at phili\"></p>\n<p>I am so grateful to family for their support in all my endeavors. It's vital to recognize the importance of your loved ones. I would be nowhere had it not been for my parents, especially when it came to selecting a college — a big decision for an 18-year-old. I have strong opinions about the world in which we live and the systems with which we operate. However, it's those opinions that drive me forward to make changes. I attended <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/\">Boston University</a>, majored in applied mathematics and computer science, and graduated with cum laude honors. To be honest, college was harder than high school but I'm glad that I went because I met great people and made some lasting memories.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/buGrad.jpg\" alt=\"andrew mollohan BU\"></p>\n<p>I guess that brings us to the present. These days I live in Boston. I spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic working from home, which was a big change. It was strange at first being isolated but that allowed me to focus on learning. I picked up running when the gyms shut down and completed a couple half marathons since then. I still spend a lot of my free time in the winter skiing with friends and family.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/about","title":"About"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b8f66ac3-63e3-5bce-94dc-973a1a170956","frontmatter__slug":"/about","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"about"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
